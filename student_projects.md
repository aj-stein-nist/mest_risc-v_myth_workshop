# MYTH RISC-V (RV32I) CPU Cores

Many students who have taken part in this MYTH Workshop have released their work as open-source cores. These are some good ones:
- [Abhinand Amarnath](https://github.com/abhierao/RISCV_CORE_4_Stage)
- [Amit Roy](https://github.com/AMITROY71/risc-v-myth-workshop-august-AMITROY71)

These cores are significant in that:
  - They were created by students with limited logic design experience in a 5-day Workshop.
  - They implement a 4-stage pipelined RV32I in < 200 lines of code.
  - They are documented to help others create cores of their own.
  
All these cores can be compiled and simulated by cut-n-pasting into the [makerchip.com](makerchip.com) IDE.
